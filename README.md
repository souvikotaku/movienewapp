# This is a Movie Dashboard App that I made for interview purpose

# The app is deployed here on netlify

https://moviedashboardsearch.netlify.app/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

# Features in the app
1) There is a search box on top, you can search for any movie by typing it there.
2) There is a filter icon near the search box. When you click on that, a small popup will open and inside you can filter either year or genre and the movies matching to them would show below.
3) Inside the movie cards, there are oscar wins/nominations bar chart, a language pie chart and the cast shown in a leaderboard box format.

# This app has been made responsive for mobile devices hence it would look great in smartphones.
